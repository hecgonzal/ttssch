# ttssch

A Python-based scheduling and alarm application that uses text-to-speech (TTS)
and AI assistance to simplify daily planning.

The goal of this project is to reduce schedule creation to a natural,
conversational interaction with an AI, while still allowing full manual control
over tasks and reminders.

## Features
- Create daily schedules with tasks that include start and end times
- Detect and prevent scheduling conflicts (planned)
- Create alarms with custom text-to-speech messages
- Simple command-line interface (GUI planned)
- AI-assisted schedule generation (planned)

Motivation

This project is intended to deepen my understanding of how modern applications
are designed and built, particularly in the areas of automation, system design,
and cross-platform functionality.

Primary goals include:
  Applying recently acquired Python skills
  Creating a portfolio project suitable for resume review
  Experimenting with API integration
  Practicing a realistic development workflow outside of a classroom environment
